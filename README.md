# Graduation_BCS
Here are all my codes during bachelor's degree in Computer Science. All this stuff is/was at UFPR, a brazilian university in the state of Paraná, in the capital Curitiba. As you can imagine, some things are in Brazilian Portuguese so if you can not understand I am sorry. Any questions about this repository can be asked to me, make a way through here or linkedin and try contact, I'll try to respond anything in a viable time.
